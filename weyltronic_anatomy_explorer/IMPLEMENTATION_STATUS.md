# Implementation Status

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation status of the Weyltronic Biological Computing Anatomy Educational Explorer components as specified in PROMPTS.md.

## ‚úÖ Completed Components

### Core Components
- ‚úÖ `core/cells.py` - WeyltonicCell class with FPGA organelles
- ‚úÖ `core/tissues.py` - WeyltonicTissue with emergent behaviors  
- ‚úÖ `core/organs.py` - Multiple organ systems (Vascular, Support, Processing, Respiratory, Immune)
- ‚úÖ `core/organelles.py` - FPGA-based organelle implementation

### Quantum Components
- ‚úÖ `quantum/weyl_transport.py` - Topologically protected quantum channels
- ‚úÖ `quantum/coherence.py` - Coherence tracking and protection

### Genomics System
- ‚úÖ `genomics/genetic_code.py` - Genetic programming language
- ‚úÖ `genomics/gene_expression.py` - Dynamic FPGA reconfiguration

### Interfaces
- ‚úÖ `interfaces/educational_ui.py` - Educational interface (placeholder implementation)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `interfaces/explorer_cli.py` - Original file had issues, created simplified version:
  - ‚úÖ `interfaces/explorer_cli_simple.py` - Working simplified CLI
  - ‚úÖ `interfaces/explorer_cli_fixed.py` - Compatibility wrapper

### Visualization (All with placeholder implementations as requested)
- ‚úÖ `visualization/cellular_anatomy.py` - Cell structure visualization
- ‚úÖ `visualization/tissue_development.py` - Tissue growth animations
- ‚úÖ `visualization/organ_systems.py` - Organ system visualization
- ‚úÖ `visualization/quantum_coherence.py` - Quantum state visualization
- ‚úÖ `visualization/resource_distribution.py` - Resource flow visualization
- ‚úÖ `visualization/growth_patterns.py` - Growth pattern visualization
- ‚úÖ `visualization/architecture_compare.py` - Architecture comparison

### Example Programs
- ‚úÖ `examples/single_cell_explorer.py` - Interactive single cell exploration
- ‚úÖ `examples/tissue_formation.py` - Tissue formation demonstration

### Supporting Files
- ‚úÖ `main.py` - Main entry point (updated to use simplified CLI)
- ‚úÖ `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- ‚úÖ `utils/config.py` - Configuration management
- ‚úÖ `utils/helpers.py` - Helper functions

## üìù Notes

### Explorer CLI Issue
The original `explorer_cli.py` implementation was causing issues (as noted by the user - "agent got stuck multiple times"). Created a simplified but fully functional version in `explorer_cli_simple.py` that provides all core functionality without the complexity that was causing problems.

### Placeholder Implementations
As requested by the user, visualization components use placeholder implementations. The structure and interfaces are complete, but actual visualization rendering is stubbed out with descriptive placeholders.

### Import Errors
The following import errors are expected in the development environment:
- `matplotlib` - Used in visualization modules
- `questionary` - Used in CLI interface
- `networkx` - Used in some modules

These will resolve when the packages are installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## üöÄ Running the Project

To run the explorer:
```bash
python main.py
```

To run example programs:
```bash
python examples/single_cell_explorer.py
python examples/tissue_formation.py
```

## üéØ Future Enhancements

When ready to move beyond placeholders:
1. Implement actual matplotlib visualizations
2. Add 3D visualization support
3. Create interactive Jupyter notebooks
4. Enhance the CLI with more features
5. Add real-time simulation capabilities
