Looking at your project, I can see why you're concerned about viability. You're absolutely right - what's been built so far appears to be mostly interactive questionnaire interfaces without the substantial computational core that would make this a meaningful biological computing simulation.

The fundamental issue is that you're trying to create an educational explorer for "Weyltronic biological computing anatomy" - but this concept exists primarily in the theoretical/speculative realm. The current implementation seems to focus on the user interface layer while the actual computational biology simulation engine is missing.

Here are the core problems I see with the current approach:

## Missing Scientific Foundation
- **Weyl semimetals** are real materials with interesting topological properties, but their application to biological computing is highly speculative
- The connection between FPGA logic blocks and biological organelles needs much stronger scientific grounding
- "Computational anatomy" as distinct from computer architecture needs clearer definition

## Lack of Persistent Models
You're right that everything staying in memory makes this non-viable. For an educational tool, you need:
- Persistent cellular configurations that can be saved/loaded
- Historical data on tissue development and growth patterns
- Experimental results that can be compared over time
- A way to build complexity incrementally

## Missing Core Simulation Engine
The prompts focus heavily on interfaces but lack the mathematical/computational core:
- No actual models of how organelles would function as FPGA blocks
- No simulation of quantum transport in biological systems
- No growth algorithms or cellular division mechanics
- No energy/resource flow calculations

## Recommendations for Making This Viable

### 1. Start with a Simpler, More Grounded Approach
Instead of full "Weyltronic biological computing," consider:
- Cellular automata that model basic biological principles
- FPGA-like reconfigurable computing cells with simple rules
- Abstract biological processes (growth, division, specialization) without quantum mechanics

### 2. Build the Core Engine First
Before any interfaces, create:
- A `BiologicalComputingEngine` that can actually simulate cellular behavior
- Persistent data structures (JSON/SQLite) for storing configurations
- Mathematical models for resource flow and energy consumption
- Growth algorithms that produce emergent tissue patterns

### 3. Focus on Educational Value
Ask: "What biological computing concepts do we actually want to teach?"
- How parallel, distributed computing differs from sequential processing
- How self-organization emerges from simple rules
- How biological systems achieve efficiency through specialization
- How fault tolerance works in biological systems

### 4. Make It Scientifically Honest
Rather than claiming to simulate "Weyltronic" systems:
- Present this as exploring "bio-inspired computing principles"
- Use real biological concepts as metaphors for computational ideas
- Be clear about what's speculation vs. established science

Would you like to discuss refocusing this project on a more achievable and educationally valuable core? I think there's a genuinely interesting project here, but it needs to be grounded in implementable computational models rather than speculative quantum biology.
