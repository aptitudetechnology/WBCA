# Weyltronic Biological Computing Anatomy Explorer - MVP

An educational tool for exploring biological computing concepts through interactive cellular anatomy.

## Quick Start

1. **Setup**:
   ```bash
   ./setup_weyltronic_explorer.sh  # If running the setup script
   # OR manually:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run Main Explorer**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Try Examples**:
   ```bash
   python examples/single_cell_explorer.py
   ```

## Core Concepts

- **FPGA-Based Cellular Units**: Each cell contains organelles implemented as reconfigurable FPGA logic blocks
- **Weyltronic Quantum Transport**: Topologically protected quantum channels for information transfer
- **Biological Computing Anatomy**: How computational systems can be organized like biological organs
- **Genetic Programming**: Dynamic reconfiguration of cellular components through genetic code

## Current MVP Features

- ✅ Basic cell creation and configuration
- ✅ Core organelles (Nucleus, Ribosomes, Mitochondria)
- ✅ Interactive CLI with questionary and rich
- ✅ Organelle exploration and status display
- ✅ Tutorial mode for educational guidance
- ✅ Single cell example demonstration

## Next Development Steps

See `PROMPTS.md` for detailed prompts to create the remaining components:
- Additional organelle types
- Tissue and organ system modeling
- Quantum transport implementation
- Advanced visualization
- More educational scenarios
